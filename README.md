# Big-Data-IP-Anomaly-Detection-BloomFilter-MisraGries
A scalable and efficient real-time IP anomaly detection system leveraging Bloom Filters and the Misra-Gries Algorithm to identify malicious traffic, detect heavy hitters, and dynamically update blacklists with minimal memory usage
Here's a structured and professional README template for your project, complete with placeholders for analysis graphs and detailed explanations of the **Bloom Filter** and **Misra-Gries Algorithm** concepts. 

## Overview

This project presents a scalable, efficient, and real-time approach to detecting anomalous IP addresses in network traffic. By combining **Bloom Filters** with the **Misra-Gries Algorithm**, we provide a memory-efficient solution capable of identifying suspicious IPs, heavy hitters, and dynamically updating blacklists. This approach is ideal for applications in cybersecurity, DDoS prevention, and enterprise network monitoring.

## Workflow of the Project

The project workflow systematically processes incoming IP addresses through a multi-stage detection pipeline:

1. **Initial IP Check**:
   - Incoming IP addresses are first checked against the **Bad IP Bloom Filter**.
   - If a match is found, the IP is immediately classified as **Prohibited** and restricted from entering the system.

2. **Safe IP Check**:
   - IPs that pass the Bad IP Bloom Filter are then checked against the **Good IP Bloom Filter**.
   - If a match is found, the IP is considered **Safe**, and the system does not track its further entries to save memory and processing power.

3. **Risky IP Tagging**:
   - IPs that do not match either the Bad or Good Bloom Filter are classified as **Risky**.
   - The system begins tracking their occurrences in the data stream.

4. **Heavy Hitter Detection**:
   - The **Misra-Gries Algorithm** is applied to the **Risky IPs** to count their occurrences and identify **Heavy Hitters** (frequently appearing IPs that exceed a predefined threshold).
   - These heavy hitters are considered **Hazardous** and flagged for further action.

5. **Blacklist Update**:
   - Hazardous IPs identified as heavy hitters are dynamically added to the **Bad IP Bloom Filter**.
   - This ensures that future occurrences of these IPs are immediately blocked, improving the system's adaptability and security.

6. **Result Aggregation and Storage**:
   - The system aggregates results into four classifications:
     - **Prohibited IPs**: Detected in the Bad IP Bloom Filter.
     - **Safe IPs**: Detected in the Good IP Bloom Filter.
     - **Risky IPs**: Neither in the Good nor Bad filters, tracked for analysis.
     - **Heavy Hitters**: Risky IPs identified by the Misra-Gries Algorithm as frequent offenders.
   - The updated **Bad IP Bloom Filter** is persisted for future use.

## Key Concepts

### Bloom Filter
A **Bloom Filter** is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It can result in false positives but guarantees no false negatives.

**Advantages**:
- **Memory Efficient**: Represents a large dataset compactly.
- **Fast Lookup**: Performs membership checks in constant time.

**How it Works**:
1. Hash each input element using multiple hash functions.
2. Update bits in a fixed-size bit array corresponding to hash outputs.
3. To check membership, rehash the query and verify if all corresponding bits are set.

### Misra-Gries Algorithm
The **Misra-Gries Algorithm** identifies frequent elements in a stream using a fixed amount of memory. It is well-suited for detecting "heavy hitters" under memory constraints.

**Steps**:
1. Track a limited number of counters for unique elements.
2. Increment counters for elements in the set, or reduce all counters if full.
3. Extract elements exceeding a frequency threshold as heavy hitters.

**Applications**:
- Identifying top traffic sources in network streams.
- Detecting DDoS attack patterns.
